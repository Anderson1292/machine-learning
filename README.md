# Machine Learning
This is the ability of a man-made device to analyze data to automate the creation of analytical models.

It is, therefore, a branch of artificial intelligence, a broader concept, which concerns the ability of a machine to make decisions based on reasoning that resembles human thinking.

In the case of Machine Learning, these decisions made by the equipment are expected to be based on learning from data and identifying patterns with minimal (or no) human intervention.

Machine Learning was born from the idea that machines could learn to perform specific tasks even without having been programmed to do so.

The great goal of a developer in this field of AI is to create software that, when exposed to new data, can adapt independently.
